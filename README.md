Solutions
MediaPipe Solutions provides a suite of libraries and tools for you to quickly apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in your applications. You can plug these solutions into your applications immediately, customize them to your needs, and use them across multiple development platforms. MediaPipe Solutions is part of the MediaPipe open source project, so you can further customize the solutions code to meet your application needs.

These libraries and resources provide the core functionality for each MediaPipe Solution:

MediaPipe Tasks: Cross-platform APIs and libraries for deploying solutions. Learn more.
MediaPipe models: Pre-trained, ready-to-run models for use with each solution.
These tools let you customize and evaluate solutions:

MediaPipe Model Maker: Customize models for solutions with your data. Learn more.
MediaPipe Studio: Visualize, evaluate, and benchmark solutions in your browser. Learn more.
Legacy solutions
We have ended support for these MediaPipe Legacy Solutions as of March 1, 2023. All other MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will be upgraded to a new MediaPipe Solution. See the Solutions guide for details. The code repository and prebuilt binaries for all MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will continue to be provided on an as-is basis.

For more on the legacy solutions, see the documentation.
